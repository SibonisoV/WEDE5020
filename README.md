1. Choose a Target Organisation:

1.1 Select a target organisation (real or hypothetical) for your website project. Consider the following options:
•	Non-Profit Organisation: A local charity, community group, or non-profit organisation.
•	Small Business: A small business owner, such as a plumber, electrician, carpenter, or baker.
•	Retail Store: A local retail store that sells products online or in-store.

Project Goals: The primary goal of this project is to create a functional and visually appealing website that meets the needs of your target organisation. Your website should be easy to navigate, informative, and engaging.

2. Research and Planning

2.1. Website Project Proposal 

To help you plan your project effectively, create a detailed project proposal. You are required to demonstrate your ability to think critically and creatively and, therefore, will need to submit two different project proposals for two different target organisations. Each proposal should be approximately 300-500 words.

Formatting Guidelines:
•	Use a clear and consistent font (Aptos) and font size (11).
•	Line-spacing should be set to 1.5.
•	The cover page should include: the subject name and code, your full name, student number, and group (if applicable).
•	A formatted Table of Contents.
•	Use headings and subheadings to organise the document.
•	Use bullet points and numbered lists to structure information.
•	Use screenshots or diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.
•	Proofread carefully to ensure accuracy and clarity.

Proposal Content:
if the storyline is fictional, you would still be required to present realistic content for the fictional client.
1. Organisation Overview:
•	Name: [Organisation Name]
•	Provide a brief history of the organisation.
•	Mission and vision statements.
•	Target audience.
2. Website Goals and Objectives:
•	Define specific goals for the website (e.g., increase website traffic, generate leads, sell products, or provide valuable information).
•	Determine and present key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success.
3. Current Website Analysis (if applicable):
•	Analyse strengths and weaknesses of the existing website.
•	Identify areas for improvement based on the weaknesses identified.
4. Proposed Website Features and Functionality:
•	Outline essential features (e.g., homepage, about us, contact page, products/services page) and the desired functionality.
5. Design and User Experience:
•	Discuss the overall design aesthetic and branding, highlighting the following:
•	Colour Scheme: [Proposed Colour Palette]
•	Typography: [Font Choices and Hierarchy]
•	Layout and Design: [Overall Design Approach]
•	User experience considerations (e.g., navigation, layout, colour scheme).
•	Develop low-fidelity wireframes to visualise the website's layout and information hierarchy.
6. Technical Requirements:
•	Identify hosting and domain name requirements and programming languages and frameworks (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
7. Timeline and Milestones:
•	Create a realistic project timeline with key milestones that follow the timeline during the subject's submission dates.
8. Budget:
•	Estimate the budget for development, hosting, and maintenance (while this is a series of assignments, the budget should reflect realistic amounts based on your research).
9. References:
•	References listed here are unique to the chosen organisation and the researched documentation of the Website Project Proposal. The references listed in this document and the general references used to complete Part 1 will be compiled in the README.md document in the repository for the entire PoE.
